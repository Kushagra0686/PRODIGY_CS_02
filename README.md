Serpent Steganography Tool üêç
===========================================

This repository contains the Python script `serpent.py`, a ü™Ñ magical tool for steganography using pixel image manipulation!  Steganography is the art of concealing a secret message within an ordinary image, making it invisible to the naked eye .

**Key Features ‚ú®**

* **Encode messages:**  Embed a secret message within an image, like a spy hiding intel in plain sight! 
* **Decode messages:**  Extract the hidden message from a steganographic image, uncovering the secret!
* **User-friendly interface:**  Interact with the script through a simple menu for an effortless experience.
* **Image format support:** Ô∏è Supports various image formats like JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF for image flexibility.

**Important Note ‚ö†Ô∏è**

While `serpent.py` provides a basic implementation of steganography, it might not be suitable for highly confidential messages.  For enhanced security, explore more advanced steganography techniques.

**Installation** 

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3 and the Pillow library (`pip install Pillow`) installed on your system.
2. **Clone the repository:** Use `git clone https://github.com/Kushagra0686/PRODIGY_CS_02.git` to clone this repository locally .

**Usage** 

1. **Navigate:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `serpent.py` script (i.e., the `PRODIGY_CS_02` directory).
2. **Run the script:** Execute the script using `python serpent.py`.

**Interactivity** Ô∏è

The script will present you with a menu where you can choose between encoding or decoding a message:

* **Encode:** Select 'encode' to embed a message within an image. You'll be prompted to choose an image, enter your secret message, and specify a filename to save the steganographic image.
* **Decode:** Select 'decode' to extract a hidden message from an image. You'll be prompted to choose the image containing the hidden message.

**Example** 

Here's a basic example of using the script for encoding:

```
Enter 'encode' or 'decode': encode

Image Selected: /home/user/images/secret_image.png

Enter the message (for Encoding -- please append space -> '' after end of message ): This is a secret message!

Image saved successfully at: /home/user/steganographic_image.png
```

**Disclaimer** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This script is intended for educational purposes only. It's recommended to explore more robust steganography techniques for real-world scenarios with higher security requirements.
